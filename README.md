# Spectral Program for the SMRK Hamiltonian

## Overview

This document outlines the **spectral research program** associated with the SMRK
Hamiltonian, positioning the Riemann Hypothesis as a **structural spectral problem**
rather than an isolated analytic conjecture.

It does not claim a proof of RH. Instead, it evaluates how far an operator-based
approach has progressed toward making RH a well-posed and falsifiable statement.

---

## Central Thesis

The Riemann Hypothesis is best interpreted as:
> a spectral regularity condition of a global arithmetic Hamiltonian.

Within this view:
- critical-line alignment follows from self-adjointness,
- explicit formulas arise as trace identities,
- functional equations correspond to symmetry.
